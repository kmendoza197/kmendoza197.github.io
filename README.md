### Projects

- [Project 1: California Policecard Project](california-policecard-project.md)
  
  **Description**: A project aimed to explore the relationship between police shootings from 2016-2018 across low and high-income categories within various police and sheriff agencies in         California. Using data from Campaign Zero, focused on police violence and accountability, we analyzed total police shootings from 2016-2018 from the police-arrests data table and median    incomes from the police-demographic data table.

- [Project 2: Connor Stevens Model Experiment](connor-stevens-model-experiment.md)
  
  **Description**: A project focused on exploring the influence of A-type potassium currents in neural excitability through the Connor-Stevens Model. It demonstrates the implementation of the    Connor-Stevens neuronal model using MATLAB. This model is widely used in neuroscience to simulate the behavior of neurons, taking into account various parameters that govern their          electrical activity.


- [Project 3: PharmaCare Insight Design](PharmaCare-Insight-design.md)
  
  **Description**: This project served to design a database that aims to collect and analyze pharmacovigilance data for Phase IV drugs developed by the pharmaceutical company, focusing on        adverse drug reactions and safety profiles. It includes patient demographics for those prescribed Phase IV drugs, along with adverse event data. It supports querying for comprehensive      pharmaceutical data management, patient care, and drug safety monitoring, facilitating analysis of drug effects and safety profiles.
